## Summary of Purpose  

This is not a program. 

This is just a analysis that tries to predict the search-trends, stock-price, & sales of a company. These predictions are made using Facebook's "Prophet" library (fbprophet).

## Required/Compatible Technologies/How to Open the Code

**Compatible OS's:** Mac, Windows, or Linux  
**Programming language:** Python inside of a Jupyter Notebook  
**Required libraries/installations:**  

    !pip install pystan~=2.14  
    !pip install fbprophet  
    !pip install hvplot  
    !pip install holoviews  
  

    import pandas as pd
    import holoviews as hv
    from fbprophet import Prophet
    import hvplot.pandas
    import datetime as dt
    %matplotlib inline
    from pathlib import Path
    import numpy as np
     
Using Google Colab is preferable.

If you want to run the code locally, using a conda environment from anaconda is preferable.


To view the code, download the repository & open it with Google Colab. 

Alternatively open it with Jupyter Lab or some program that can run .ipynb files (e.g. VS Code using some extensions/add-ons).

The cells should have already been run. If some haven't been run, then restart the kernel and run all the cells.

If you are having trouble downloading the repository: Go to the .ipynb file on github & hit download. If you are taken to some githubusercontent.com page, wait for the page to load, then hit Ctrl+S. Then, when you have a ".ipynb.txt" file, you can delete the ".txt", and open the file as normal. Then download the "Resources" folder and everything else individually aswell.
